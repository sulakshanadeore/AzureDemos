 very responsive apps and always require it to be online, instances of these apps are 
deployed in the datacenters that are close to the users of the app, achieve low latency (faster) 
and high availability.

Appls need to respond in real time to large changes in the peak hours, store ever increasing volumes 
of data, and make this data available to users in milliseconds.

Advantages:
-->Azure Cosmos DB is a fully managed NoSQL database for modern app development.
-->Single-digit millisecond response time.
-->automatic and instant scalability
-->guarantee the speed at any scale
--> ensures business continuity
-->support for azure functions(triggered events)

How are the advantages achieved?
1) turnkey multi-region data distribution anywhere in the world.(gzrs)
2) open source api's
3) sdks for popular languages
-----------------------------
cosmos db is multi-model nosql
types of no-sql databases:
1) key-value pairs
2) documents--extend the concept of key-value database by organising entire documents into groups 
called collections.
3) Columnar
4) Graph

No-SQL--> non relational
---------------------------------------------------------

separate your data based on some parameter, 
 partition key:--- data will be bifurcated.

Azure Virtual Network:(VNET) is the fundamental building block for creating private network in Azure.
It enables many types of Azure resources, for example: 
1) VM---> securely communicate with each other, the internet and on-premises network.
latency, scalability,availability and isolation.
Advantages:
1) enables azure resources--network traffic, routing request.

2) outbound to internet
inbound- public ip address or load balancer
all the machines in the network(LAN)
in lan each machine requires a ip address and if there are multiple machines, internal Load balancer.

3)Outbound-(SNAT--Source network address translation)--- maps ip address of the backend to public ip address of your load balancer.

4) filter the network traffic

5) routing the network traffic

6) no charge for using azure vnet.
only vm charges are payable

7) virtual networks can be available over zones  in  a region.

 VM                    |  Network gateway    |                VM

1) Created 2 VNets
2) Created connection  gateway from the connections of the second VNET1/2.
3) network watcher is created for filtering and the routing the data between 2 vnets using Network 
Gateway and connection network.
4) create 1 vm in in both the vnets.
5 a) start remote desktop connection---vm1
5 b) start remote desktop connection---vm2

6) outbound connection of ip address of vm2 try to connect with vm1 ----(rdp)
