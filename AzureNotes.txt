----------------------------------------
Azure is a cloud platform.
Azure gives the following services to its users/customers:
1)Infrastructure as a Service: (IAAS)
2)Software as a Service(SAAS)

Virtual Machine Introduction:
Virtual Machine: is a sub machine introduced for the purpose of creating a environment for 
working, and running/hosting the project/software.

Virtualization:
Azure VM are on-demand computing resource or virtual machine offering by Microsoft Azure.
We can shutdown or startup the VM as per our requirement.
It comes under IAAS.

Virtual Machine: we get a readymade computer system that has been made available by Visualization.
VM is a copy of some part of the shared resource in the data center to be optimised and used according to need.

Why ?
1) Pricing: shutdown and stop vm when not requied, Pay as per your requirement, which makes it very economical.
2) Security:More Control over security for the developers, they can choose OS,network,storage connections etc.
3) Scaling : as per requirement, up/down scaling. Auto scale feature support is available.
Scaling is availabel on the basis of CPU utilisation.
If the time limit is taken more than 5 minutes, 70% on a single CPU, then u can use multiple CPU's, 
and thereby scale up your application so the performance will not be hampered.
a) Vertical---size of VM us changed.
UpGrade--increase
DownGrade--decrease

b) Horizontal----- increasing or decreasing the number of VM's
Load balancer is implicitly given with increasing or decreasing number of VM's.

4) Scale Sets: VM Scale sets are a group of VMs with identical configuration and will be managed by the load balancer.

How a VM is created/parameters on which it is created?
1) General Purpose---balanced CPU and memory ratio, for development and testing.
2) Compute Optimised--heavy background tasks
3) Memory Optimised---High memory to CPU ratio, relational db,in memory analytics
4) storage Optimised--high storage, 'L' sized ,used for  big data, no SQL
5)GPU--- grahic intensive, video editing etc
6)High Performance--- highest through put

Resource Group---logical container for the all the related resources based on the lifetime of the resources. 
Set of other resources based on the resource groups.

.Net allows creation of Web Services-----> http
.Net allows creation of WCF Services-----> http/https/udp/tcp etc
.Net allows creation of REST API Services-----> device support
